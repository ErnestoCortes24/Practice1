*Conclusion*
I can tell in this practice I could learned to use KiCad. First, the difference between a PSpice and a PCB creator is the libraries that you need to put. I mean, the libraries that you have to put to create a desired circuit. Among enything else is the same.
In this case, all the components were added in a A3 sheet with Pots, LCDs, MAX 232, PushButtons, power supply, Leds and matrix keyboard. I just added the components required and conect with wires.  
Finally, something that I didn't understand is why the components are separated. I think, in base with this components will create a PCB module, and I don't undertand why.
